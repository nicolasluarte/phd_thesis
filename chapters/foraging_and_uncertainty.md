## Foraging and uncertainty

Certain food-seeking strategies, such as the LÃ©vy-Walks, emerge product of the
irreducible uncertainty the animal faces when foraging. Uncertainty then
informs food-seeking behavior. However, how animals capture o process this
uncertainty while searching for food has not yet been explained, such is the
aim of this section.

## animals must deal with uncertainty to produce optimal decisions

If an animal perform any food-seeking strategy in a specific area of the
environment there exists a probability of having success, which is dependent on
resource density and the specific strategy. Fixing the strategy, the
probability is determined by the resource density, moreover, as the resource
density changes over time so does the probability of successfuly obtaining
food. Moreover, in conjuntion with limited perceptual abilities
[@9XCDNBAM#Bartumeus_Etal_2016 ], the environment appears as being of
stochastic nature [@DIMJNJV2#Caraco_Etal_1990].

An animal which does not consider environment stochastic nature in its
food-seeking behavior will act greedely upon sampled values. Acting greedely
implies that the animal will always choose the option that yielded the most
values in a initial random sampling. Thus, acting greedely is analogous to
neglecting that the sample comes from a stochastic distributions of rewards,
this is problematic as it makes food-seeking strategy insensitive to reward
variation [@2BEHEM7X#Sutton_Barto_2018]. One could relax this assumption and
propose that animals will act upon the mean rewards such as the classical model
by @ESYGCSLH#Charnov_1976, which determines the strategy based on current patch
value against the global mean of the environment. Nevertheless, such rule-based
models do not provide good fit to behavioral data [@GC6MVWQU#Nonacs_2001;
@9XVRLKC3#LeHeron_Etal_2020; @RR87DVIX#Pyke_2010;
@H9JQCFZA#Hayden_Pearson_Platt_2011].

Considering uncertainty in food-seeking behavior is, in part, considering (a)
the typical variance in reward when performing a foraging bout in a given
environment state, and (b) the structural changes in variance, for example,
when the environment is destroyed by a natural event. The notion of expected
and unexpected uncertainty capture both kinds of variance
[@W3DEZPKU#Yu_Dayan_2005]. Considering both kinds of uncertainty enables the
animal to balance top-down and bottom-up information, if the obtained rewards
present some variation is should not modify model that maps actions with
rewards in a given environment, so top-down control should have dominance over
bottom-up input. On the other hand, if obtained rewards present a large amount
of variation, the balance should switch in order to prioritize bottom-up input
to increase learning about new contingencies [@W3DEZPKU#Yu_Dayan_2005;
@P2FYNJKR#Soltani_Izquierdo_2019].

## environments are non-stationary, using energy to reduce uncertainty is adaptative in this scenarios
